This project allows for ids to be generated using [relops snowflake](https://github.com/relops/snowflake) libary. 
Twitters snowflake id generating algorithm allows you to generate unique ids multiple times per millisecond, and is also sequential aka number a which is older then number b will always be a lower number then every other later number this is very useful for user ids etc.
